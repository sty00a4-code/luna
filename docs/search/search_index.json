Chunk A list of statements with no seperator Block Just a list of statements like a Chunk , but it requires { at the start and } at the end. Statement A statement has a lot of variants, like let-bindings, function definitions, etc. But it also can as well just be a Block Let Binding This is what you define local variables with. The assignees can be simple identifiers or object/vector destructurings. Examples: let a = 1 , let { name, age } = person , let [first, second, third] = numbers Assign This is how you assign new values to existing variables. The assignees can be simple identifiers or a field/index into an object/vector Examples: a = 2 Assign Operation Written the same way as Assign expect with any of the following assign operators, only one assignee and only one expression: assign operators += -= *= /= ^= %= Examples: a += 1 , b *= 2 Call This is to call functions with arguments. The callee can either be a simple identifier or a field/index of an object/vector. Examples: print(\"Hello, World!\") , self.add(1) Self Call Just like a Call only written with a : followed by an identifier. This calls the function with the first argument being the value before the : . This is used to call objects with themselfs for object-oriented design patterns. Examples: vector:push(1) , person:greet() Function Definition This is used to globally define functions with parameters. Examples: fn add(a, b) { return a + b } Let-Function Definition This is used to locally define functions with parameters in the current scope. Examples: let fn add(a, b) { return a + b } If-Branch Classical if-branch like any other. Has an optional else-case which can either be a block or another if-branch. Examples: if cond { print(\"yay\") } else { print(\"nay\") } , if cond { print(\"yay\") } else if cond2 { print(\"semi-yay\") } While-Loop Classical while-loop like any other. body has to be a block Examples: while a < 10 { a += 1 } For-Loop Python-like for-loop that requires an iterable to be right of the in keyword. Only one variable can be given for each iteration. An iterable can either be an user-object with a next method, an object with the meta variable __next which is a function, or just a function. Examples: for n in [1, 2, 3]:iter() { print(n) } , for key in keys(map) { print(key, map[key]) } Return This is used to return a value to the caller and end execution of the current function. Examples: return a + b , return null Break This is used to break out of any loop. Examples: while true { if a >= 10 { break } } Continue This is used to continue to the next iteration of the loop.
