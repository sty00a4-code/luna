# Environment
If you want to add additional functionality onto Luna you can use the `LUNA_PATH` environment variable that the Luna interpreter is using to locate modules if not found in the current directory.

The environment variable should look something like this: `~/.luna` or if you want it for all users `/.luna`.
Of course you first have to create that directory.
